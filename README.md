We see that both genders have similar curves with the majority of durations for each gender is still less than 10 minutes.

### Summary
It is clear from this analysis that the success of the NYC Citi Bike bike-sharing program is due to the consistent participation of their Male subscribers. Given that most of the trips are short duration and happen during peak commuter hours, an analysis of Des Moines' commuter environment could help determine if there are similar needs. Also, compiling some data about the reason for each trip would be helpful in understanding if there are similar needs in Des Moines.
